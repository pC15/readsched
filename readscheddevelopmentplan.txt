Reading Schedule application
*Basic App works as of 3/3/15.

Asks for:
title
number of pages
number of pages user will read in a day
how many days per week user will read
start date.

Outputs:
    summary of information (title, #pages, #pages/day, #days/week, start date)
    how many days it will take to finish the book
    Approximate date of finishing

Calculations:
    how many days it will take to finish the book:
	approximate date of finishing:


Possible issues:
    What about time difference? does that play into the date calculation? No, it doesn't.


How to make it better:
   	Form validation aka preparing for the worst user possible
   	Nice printing/formatting the response text from ajax
   	After response text, prompt to schedule reading days (ex. 2 days/week, so can pick M/T, T/Th, M/F, etc)
    

EXTRAS:
Output gives reading dates and offers to schedule them on calendar.

Think like MAL mobile app. User can update pages when finished reading, rate stars, leave reviews.
